This is a web application named “ASSISTIVE TOUCH” where we have created a room of solutions for people suffering from various ailments of the physical as well as the mental kind. Following the logon, they can avail the comfort of sharing their grievances on a platform that’s user friendly and open to all. Every candidate is given the privilege of creating their own user identity which is password protected and highly encrypted. The webpage is categorized in numerous ways for people who have lost their sense of hearing, vision, motility, limbs as well for people who have emotional or psychological ailments.  The amenities that the web application provides include information about the various helping centres, government schemes, opportunities for employment as well as special schooling, various informative articles, podcasts, links for video playlists, a network for connecting them with people who share the same grievances, calming music playlists and so on.
